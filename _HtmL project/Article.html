    <p>Deserts</p>
    <p>Deserts cover about 20% of earth’s surface.  There are four major types of desert in this biome -hot and dry, semiarid, coastal, and cold. Few plants and animals can survive their due to the extreme conditions. The saharah for example is extremely hot during the day, and extremely cold at night, and aside from oasis, there's very little water. As a result  Plants like Cactus exist their that can store water, as well as animals like the camel that stores water in its hump, and can go without a drink for long periods. Hot and dry deserts are located near the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn , and are hot because they are closer to the equator. Cold deserts could be found in arctic regions. Antarctica Is one of the world's largest deserts.  Deserts are important because they are the habitat for animals like the African Wild Dog. Arabian Wildcat. Armadillo. Ankole Longhorn Cattle. It also contains lots of oil within deserts which is a fossil fuel, because of all the animals that have died there in the past because of its extreme climate. Due to the decreased precipitation rate, the species diversity in this biomes is less as compared to other biomes like the savannah, grasslands, and chaparral.</p>

    <h1>Abiotic factors </h1>
    <p>For hot dry deserts the Temperatures exhibit daily. mean annual temperatures range from 20-25° C. The extreme maximum ranges from 43.5-49° C. Minimum temperatures sometimes drop to -18° C.Rainfall  is aldo very little in desert climates especially in Atacama Desert of Chile, where it averages less than 1.5 cm. Some years are even rainless. Inland Sahara also receives less than 1.5 cm a year. Rainfall in American deserts is higher — almost 28 cm a year. Soils are course-textured, shallow, rocky or gravely with good drainage and have no subsurface water. 
    For semiarid deserts Summer temperatures usually average between 21-27° C. It normally does not go above 38° C and evening temperatures are cool, at around 10° C. The summer is usually a long hot dry climate with concentrated rainfall during the winter. Finally cold deserts have extremely cold winters with snowfall and high rain . They have short, moist, and moderately warm summers with fairly long, cold winters. The mean winter temperature is between -2 to 4° C and the mean summer temperature is between 21-26° C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15-26 cm.
    <h1>Biotic factors</h1> 
    <p>Species diversity Desert species diversity is very much dependent on rainfall and vegetative cover, with the fewest plant and animal species in the driest deserts, because animals need water to live. The Sonoran Desert toad, desert spadefoot, northern casque-headed treefrog and others survive in the desert because of their abilities to excavate burrows as much as three feet deep where they spend nine or ten months at a time. Spadefoots and the northern casque-headed tree frogs have hardened areas, called spades, on their hind feet with which to dig.
    Succulent plants store water in fleshy leaves, stems or roots. All cacti are succulents, as are such non-cactus desert dwellers as agave, aloe. Water storing for plants is an important adaptation to the desert habitat 
    The fennec fox of North Africa has large ears which Schwartz points out serve a dual purpose: they are great for listening for bugs to eat that may be moving around underground, but they are also loaded with blood vessels, allowing the animals to dissipate excess body heat. And thick fur coat insulates from cold desert nights.</p>
